#### THE WORKERS 👷‍♂️
- Hitler’s most controversial claim was that his government “broke prejudice”, and created an equality 🤝 between the workers of the brain🧠 and the fist✊. (Although there are differing perspectives on this issue, the diversity of Hitler’s workforce can’t be denied)
- Hitler justified the dissolution of trade unions and political parties through claiming that he liberated the workers from the bureaucratic and corrupt 🤑 Marxist leaders, giving them a more respectful 🫡 place in society
    - Workers had to join the Labour Front, have their wages 💰fixed by the Trustees of Labour and to witness the enhancement of the authority in their employers (“Plant Leaders”). Factories with >20 workers had to set up a Council of Trust, in which cases against employers could be brought up (basically served as a weak substitute to trade union power) 

- The Labour Front served dual purposes: encouraging workers and offering a façade of socialism, while simultaneously depoliticizing industrial relations 🎭. It aimed to bring Hitler's 'socialism of the deed' to life.
    - 	The organization evolved two key departments influenced by 1920s welfare capitalism:
    - 	'Beauty of Work': Managed by Albert Speer, this initiative urged employers to make factories more humane and modern, introducing amenities like improved lighting, swimming baths, and canteens 🏭💡. By 1939, 67,000 firms joined the movement.
        - 'Strength through Joy' (KDF): Created to give workers recreational opportunities, aiming to eliminate boredom and foster greater loyalty to the Führer 🎭🎶.
        - Events like concerts, plays, and affordable access to previously elitist sports clubs were offered.
        - Cut-price cruises and holidays also provided 🚢🏖.
        - This led to economic dependency of several services like hotels and national railways on the Labour Front's programs.
- The most popular KDF initiative was the Volkswagen project 🚗. The plant's foundation was laid in 1938, and by 1940, 300,000 people had signed up for the car. However, WWII halted production, and not a single car was delivered.
This dual approach aimed to keep the workforce engaged, loyal, and somewhat content, while maintaining strict control and depoliticizing the work environment.
- Full employment under Hitler presented a complex dilemma. While it empowered workers economically 💪, it also led to rising wages and labor shortages, particularly in low-paying sectors 👷‍♂️📈.
- Many workers began to quit low-paying jobs, causing significant employment issues. For instance, miners and builders migrated to new, better-paying IG Farben factories and Hermann Göring Steelworks 🏭.
- With work intensity and hours increasing post-1936, absenteeism and 'go slows' surged, along with short-lived strikes ⏸🛑.
- To combat this, the regime imposed strict regulations. Employers needed approval for hiring more than ten people, and workers faced penalties for breaching contracts 📜🚫.
- Labour Trustees were empowered to set wage levels in crucial industries, and labor conscription was initiated. By August 1939, 300,000 men were conscripted for various projects 🚧.
- Employer reactions were varied:
- Companies like Siemens and Krupp attempted negotiation and tech-based labor-saving measures 🤝💡.
- Others, like those overseeing Autobahn construction, resorted to force and terrible working conditions 👊🏗.
- Extreme forms of control included surveillance and the looming threat of Gestapo and brutal 'education camps' 👮‍♂️🏰.
- Despite these measures, wages, particularly in the armament industries, continued to rise 📈.
- Lacking trade union support, workers individually or in groups managed a 'do-it-yourself' wage system, especially benefiting from piece-work rates 💰🔨.
- However, the overall average wages did not surpass their 1929 levels until 1941 📊.
Workers managed to exploit the unique economic situation, even in the absence of collective bargaining, while the regime employed a mix of negotiation, regulation, and repression to manage the challenges of full employment

- Mason's Interpretation of Workers' Behavior 🤔:
Initially, Mason viewed the workers' absenteeism and strikes as acts of defiance against the regime, a form of class warfare 🛠🔥.
Later, he softened this stance, suggesting that workers were isolated and couldn't risk rebelling 🤐🔒.
Some researchers point out that workers did form a significant part of the German resistance, albeit influenced by Nazi values to some extent 🚫✊.
- Policing the Volksgemeinschaft 🚨:
Gestapo, Criminal Police (Kripo), and uniformed police were responsible for state security 🚓.
In reality, Gestapo was relatively small and relied heavily on informers and block wardens for intelligence 🕵️‍♀️.
The media portrayed the police as the defenders of society against 'deviants,' often implying these were Jews, Communists, or 'asocials' 📰🎯.
The Hitler Myth as an Integrative Factor 🙌:
Hitler was presented as a god-like figure, embodying national unity and standing against Communism and Jews 🦸‍♂️🇩🇪.
While not entirely successful in all circles, the myth did resonate strongly with the German middle classes 👥.
This was facilitated by nationalism, economic recovery, and diplomatic/military successes, making Hitler a symbol of unity at least until Stalingrad 🏆⚔️.

####  The racial state 💯

Worker's Stance in Nazi Germany 🛠
Initially, historians like Mason saw worker's absenteeism and stoppages as acts of defiance. Later, he toned down the view, acknowledging that workers were essentially "imprisoned" with no room for rebellion.
Younger workers were swayed by retraining and new job opportunities, while material benefits like longer holidays bought workers' acquiescence.
Post-war, many workers nostalgically remembered 1934–39 for full employment and stability, not necessarily Nazi ideologies.
Policing the Volksgemeinschaft 👮‍♂️
The Gestapo, Criminal Police, and uniformed police acted as the guardians of the Nazi social order. They targeted political and 'asocial' enemies.
The Gestapo was not as omnipotent as believed, relying heavily on informants and block wardens for information.
The Hitler Myth 🎭
Hitler was deified by Nazi propaganda, serving as an embodiment of national unity.
The myth had varying degrees of success in different social groups but was a strong unifying force until the battle of Stalingrad.
Racial and Eugenic Policies in the Third Reich 🧬
The regime aimed for a racially homogeneous 'Aryan' society, aiming to eliminate minorities and even 'lesser' Aryans.
Influenced by earlier theories and the economic situation, eugenic policies gained traction, leading to forced sterilizations and eventually to euthanasia.
Public outcry and tactical reasons led to a temporary halt in the euthanasia program, which had resulted in thousands of deaths.

Nazi Persecution Programs: Targeting Various Groups
Euthanasia Program: Originally aimed at euthanizing the mentally sick, this program later included foreign workers with severe illnesses, prisoners, and even German soldiers with incurable conditions. Methods included starvation and lethal injections. Films like "I Accuse" were used to sway public opinion towards euthanasia. 💉🎬
Specific Target Groups

'Asocials' and Homosexuals: The Nazis believed that criminal and sexually deviant behaviors were genetically determined. Compulsory castration laws were enacted. Himmler, appointed chief of German police in June 1936, intensified arrests and incarcerations in concentration camps.👮🏻‍♂️🤔
Over 10,000 people were arrested and most perished in SS-owned quarries. Between 1937-1939, 25,000 homosexuals were arrested; 15,000 were sent to concentration camps.
Ethnic Minorities: Policies targeting smaller ethnic groups like Sinti, Roma, Sorbs and part-Africans evolved between 1933–40.
Sinti and Roma were moved and sterilized; some were later sent to Auschwitz.
Sorbs were initially tolerated, but later their leaders were sent to concentration camps.
The Jews: Most Persecuted Group

Public Perception: Jews were viewed as the epitome of evil, seen as a threat to the racial state. 👹
Intentionalists vs. Structuralists: Intentionalists argue that the extermination of Jews was pre-planned, while Structuralists claim it was the result of chaotic policy-making. Both perspectives have merits and demerits.
Note: Understanding the Nazi persecution of the Jews involves acknowledging both the structuralist and intentionalist viewpoints. 👥
In summary, the Nazi regime's targeting of various groups was rooted in a eugenics-based ideology that sought to purify German society through increasingly harsh and organized measures. 🎯

Euthanasia and Extermination Centers 🏥: Initially focused on euthanizing the mentally ill, the scope expanded to include other groups such as foreign workers, prisoners, and soldiers with incurable shell shock. These individuals were starved or lethally injected, often under public opinion manipulation schemes like the film I Accuse.
'Asocials' and Homosexuals 🚷: The Nazis criminalized these groups based on the belief that their behaviors were genetically predetermined. Sterilization and imprisonment in concentration camps were common penalties. Thousands perished under harsh conditions.
Gypsies, Part-Africans, and Slavs 🌍: Though less researched, these smaller ethnic groups also faced intense persecution. Gypsies were forcibly relocated and many were sent to Auschwitz. Plans for the Sorbs never fully materialized, but their leaders were incarcerated.
Jews ✡: The most persecuted minority, initially subjected to economic and social restrictions like boycotts of Jewish shops and expulsion from civil service. Policies intensified over time, culminating in the Nuremberg Laws, which banned marriage between Jews and non-Jews and stripped Jews of their German citizenship.
Controversial Theories

Intentionalists vs. Structuralists 📚: Intentionalists argue Hitler always intended to exterminate Jews, while Structuralists see the Holocaust as a result of chaotic policy-making within the Nazi regime. Most historians agree that both factors played a role.
Economic and Political Realities 🌐: Initially, global criticisms and economic considerations forced the Nazis to moderate their anti-Semitic actions. For example, the Nazis struck a deal with the Anglo-Palestine Bank to avert a worldwide boycott.
Policy Shifts Over Time ⏳

Initial measures included shop boycotts and exclusion from the civil service.
The Nuremberg Laws, which outlawed marriages between Jews and non-Jews and stripped Jews of their citizenship, were introduced in a climate of rising anti-Semitic violence and political agitation.

From 1937 to 1938, Hitler remained vague about his anti-Semitic policies, allowing top Nazis and departments to propose their own solutions 🛠️, often contradicting each other.
One official wanted Jews as potential hostages 🏴, while another wanted them out of Germany 🇩🇪 as soon as possible.
After Schacht's resignation in 1937, Göring took control 🎮 and escalated anti-Semitic policies, taking advantage of Austria's Anschluss and looming Czechoslovakia conflict 🌍.
The November 1938 Reichskristallnacht ("Night of Broken Glass" 🪟) was a turning point.
Orchestrated by Goebbels, 100 Jews killed, 30,000 sent to camps 🏕️, and massive property damage 💥.
It marked a new phase, consolidating power in Göring’s office for further anti-Jewish measures 💼.
By April 1939, most Jewish wealth was confiscated 💰 and they were barred from public spaces 🚫 and expelled from schools 🏫.
Heydrich was put in charge of Jewish emigration but faced logistical issues ⛔, complicated by new territories under German control.
Hitler made vague, yet alarming, public statements 🎙️ about the annihilation of Jews, leading to different interpretations 📚.
"Intentionalists" see these as evidence of a plan, while "structuralists" caution against literal interpretation 👓.
After 1939, more prohibitive measures against Jews rolled out 🚫, including forced ghettos and the Star of David badges ⭐.
German public opinion on Jewish persecution was mixed 🔄.
Initial outrage over Reichskristallnacht's violence and property damage 😡, but no organized opposition.
General preoccupation with war survival overshadowed concern for Jewish plight 🌑.
Reichskristallnacht possibly influenced Hitler against repeating such overt pogroms due to public reaction 😶.
The secrecy 🤫 around the “Final Solution” suggested that Nazi leadership doubted public support for extreme anti-Semitism.
Despite the secrecy, rumors circulated widely, fueled by soldiers on leave 🎖️ and railway personnel 🚂.
Most Germans were preoccupied with their own hardships and showed little active sympathy for Jews 🤷‍♀️.
Hitler's Role in Foreign Policy: Most historians agree that Hitler had the final say in foreign affairs, despite inter-agency rivalry in domestic issues. Rauschning (1939) argued that Hitler decisively "leads" in foreign policy.👑
However, some argue that domestic pressures also influenced Nazi foreign policy, such as the party's demand for instant action.🏠
Aims and Motives of Hitler: Rauschning and Alan Bullock emphasize Hitler’s aim for maximum power. Bullock argued that Hitler’s one program was "power without limit."🌍
Trevor-Roper claims Hitler was a systematic thinker with a well-laid plan for Lebensraum in Russia.📚
A.J.P. Taylor's Thesis: Taylor (1961) argues Hitler was not unique but followed traditional German foreign policy aims. He denies that Hitler was preparing for a world war, instead labeling him a pragmatist.🤷‍♂️
This ignited debates and invited criticism, especially from German historians like Hillgruber and Hildebrand, who held that Hitler had a consistent, pre-planned program.🎯
Programme School’s Argument: Hillgruber and Hildebrand claim that Hitler had a two-phase plan: first continental (defeat France and conquer Russia), and then global (to defeat the USA). This is based on a close reading of Mein Kampf and Hitler’s Secret Book.📖
Taylor and the programme school have faced criticism for their extreme viewpoints. Taylor is criticized for ignoring Hitler's Lebensraum plans, and the programme school for overstating the consistency of Nazi policy.🤔
Hitler’s Immediate Priorities in 1933-1937: Destroy Versailles settlement, rearm Germany, dismantle French alliances, and secure alliances with Britain and Italy. 🎯
Achieved a significant diplomatic win with a 10-year non-aggression pact with Poland in 1934, but clarified that it was temporary.🤝
External Factors: The world situation favored Germany’s resurgence, including American isolationism, French hesitancy, and British willingness to make concessions.🌐
Hitler capitalized on these factors, leaving the disarmament conference and the League of Nations in 1933, making opportunistic alliances, and avoiding multilateral commitments.🚀
Alliance with Britain: Attempts to secure an Anglo-German air pact began in February 1935 but didn't result in an alliance. Britain aimed to moderate German rearmament rather than coerce it.✈️
Hitler responded to global attempts at disarmament by promising peaceful intentions and signing bilateral pacts, notably with Britain 🇬🇧. The British government negotiated a naval convention that somewhat enabled German rearmament, undermining a unified anti-Hitler coalition. Hitler saw this as a step towards an alliance with Britain, who saw it as taming Hitler.
This move weakened the Stresa Front, breaking the unity between Britain, France, and Italy against German rearmament.
Mussolini’s attack on Abyssinia 🌍 in 1935 gave Hitler the chance to remilitarize the Rhineland. Mussolini's approach to Hitler for support ensured that Italy would not oppose this move. Hitler capitalized on international distractions and successfully remilitarized the Rhineland 🇩🇪, altering the balance of power away from France 🇫🇷.
This marked a real turning point, depriving France of its main strategic advantage and revealing a lack of will from Britain and France to enforce existing treaties.
Hitler was determined to prepare Germany for war against the USSR 🇷🇺, and his Four Year Plan aimed at aligning the economy and military for this objective. This displayed his ideological hatred towards Bolshevism.
Hitler’s decision to support Franco in the Spanish Civil War 🇪🇸 was also influenced by Anti-Bolshevism.
Hitler also signed the Anti-Comintern Pact with Japan 🇯🇵, focusing on fighting against Bolshevism. This went against the advice of his diplomats and industrialists who saw China 🇨🇳 as a more important trade partner.
Italy later joined this pact, strengthening the anti-Comintern bloc.
By the end of 1937, Germany's diplomatic position had significantly improved, but steel shortages threatened its armaments program 🏭.
A secret meeting highlighted Hitler's aims for Lebensraum and warned of future conflicts with Britain and France. While some historians argue that the meeting was mainly 'day-dreaming,' the consensus is that Hitler was signaling a more dangerous phase in foreign policy.
The meeting led to increased focus on war preparations, including plans for an offensive war against Czechoslovakia 🇨🇿.
Hitler escalated tensions with Czechoslovakia by demanding self-determination for the Sudeten Germans 🇩🇪. British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain intervened to negotiate a settlement, hoping to prevent war ⚖️.
Hitler initially agreed to pause military actions 🚫 and to cede only areas with >50% German population. However, he later rejected the peaceful proposals, demanding an accelerated takeover of the Sudetenland. Chamberlain viewed this as a diplomatic victory; Hitler felt cheated.
A turning point occurred when Hitler took advantage of a political crisis in Czechoslovakia 🔄.
He pressured Slovakia into declaring independence, leading to the occupation of Czech territories 🗺️. Hitler used the political crisis to hasten the country's dissolution.
In early 1939, Hitler tried diplomacy with France and Poland but found little success 🚫.
After Prague's occupation, Britain and France switched from appeasement to deterrence, guaranteeing Poland against attack 🤝. This focused Hitler's plans on destroying Poland.
The Nazi–Soviet Non-Aggression Treaty of August 1939 was a game-changer 🔄.
It outlined German and Russian spheres of influence in eastern Europe and eliminated the only counterbalance against Poland's defeat.
Hitler’s last-minute diplomatic attempts aimed at isolating Poland and avoiding war with Britain and France failed ⚠️.
Hitler finally ordered an invasion of Poland on 31 August, marking the start of World War II 🌍💥.
