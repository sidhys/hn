#### THE WORKERS 👷‍♂️
- Hitler’s most controversial claim was that his government “broke prejudice”, and created an equality 🤝 between the workers of the brain🧠 and the fist✊. (Although there are differing perspectives on this issue, the diversity of Hitler’s workforce can’t be denied)
- Hitler justified the dissolution of trade unions and political parties through claiming that he liberated the workers from the bureaucratic and corrupt 🤑 Marxist leaders, giving them a more respectful 🫡 place in society
    - Workers had to join the Labour Front, have their wages 💰fixed by the Trustees of Labour and to witness the enhancement of the authority in their employers (“Plant Leaders”). Factories with >20 workers had to set up a Council of Trust, in which cases against employers could be brought up (basically served as a weak substitute to trade union power) 

- The Labour Front served dual purposes: encouraging workers and offering a façade of socialism, while simultaneously depoliticizing industrial relations 🎭. It aimed to bring Hitler's 'socialism of the deed' to life.
    - 	The organization evolved two key departments influenced by 1920s welfare capitalism:
    - 	'Beauty of Work': Managed by Albert Speer, this initiative urged employers to make factories more humane and modern, introducing amenities like improved lighting, swimming baths, and canteens 🏭💡. By 1939, 67,000 firms joined the movement.
        - 'Strength through Joy' (KDF): Created to give workers recreational opportunities, aiming to eliminate boredom and foster greater loyalty to the Führer 🎭🎶.
        - Events like concerts, plays, and affordable access to previously elitist sports clubs were offered.
        - Cut-price cruises and holidays also provided 🚢🏖.
        - This led to economic dependency of several services like hotels and national railways on the Labour Front's programs.
          - The most popular KDF initiative was the Volkswagen project 🚗. The plant's foundation was laid in 1938, and by 1940, 300,000 people had signed up for the car. However, WWII halted production, and not a single car was delivered. This dual approach aimed to keep the workforce engaged, loyal, and somewhat content, while maintaining strict control and depoliticizing the work environment.
- Full employment under Hitler presented a complex dilemma. While it empowered workers economically 💪, it also led to rising wages and labor shortages, particularly in low-paying sectors 👷‍♂️📈.
- Many workers began to quit low-paying jobs, causing significant employment issues. For instance, miners and builders migrated to new, better-paying IG Farben factories and Hermann Göring Steelworks 🏭.
- With work intensity and hours increasing post-1936, absenteeism and 'go slows' surged, along with short-lived strikes ⏸🛑.
- To combat this, the regime imposed strict regulations. Employers needed approval for hiring more than ten people, and workers faced penalties for breaching contracts 📜🚫.
- Labour Trustees were empowered to set wage levels in crucial industries, and labor conscription was initiated. By August 1939, 300,000 men were conscripted for various projects 🚧.
- Employer reactions were varied:
  - Companies like Siemens and Krupp attempted negotiation and tech-based labor-saving measures 🤝💡.
  - Others, like those overseeing Autobahn construction, resorted to force and terrible working conditions 👊🏗.
- Extreme forms of control included surveillance and the looming threat of Gestapo and brutal 'education camps' 👮‍♂️🏰.
- Despite these measures, wages, particularly in the armament industries, continued to rise 📈.
- Lacking trade union support, workers individually or in groups managed a 'do-it-yourself' wage system, especially benefiting from piece-work rates 💰🔨.
- However, the overall average wages did not surpass their 1929 levels until 1941 📊.
- Workers managed to exploit the unique economic situation, even in the absence of collective bargaining, while the regime employed a mix of negotiation, regulation, and repression to manage the challenges of full employment.

- Mason's Interpretation of Workers' Behavior 🤔:
  - Initially, Mason viewed the workers' absenteeism and strikes as acts of defiance against the regime, a form of class warfare 🛠🔥.
  - Later, he softened this stance, suggesting that workers were isolated and couldn't risk rebelling 🤐🔒.
  - Some researchers point out that workers did form a significant part of the German resistance, albeit influenced by Nazi values to some extent 🚫✊.

- Policing the Volksgemeinschaft 🚨:
  - The Gestapo, Criminal Police (Kripo), and uniformed police were responsible for state security 🚓.
  - In reality, Gestapo was relatively small and relied heavily on informers and block wardens for intelligence 🕵️‍♀️.
  - The media portrayed the police as the defenders of society against 'deviants,' often implying these were Jews, Communists, or 'asocials' 📰🎯.

- The Hitler Myth as an Integrative Factor 🙌:
  - Hitler was presented as a god-like figure, embodying national unity and standing against Communism and Jews 🦸‍♂️🇩🇪.
  - While not entirely successful in all circles, the myth did resonate strongly with the German middle classes 👥.
  - This was facilitated by nationalism, economic recovery, and diplomatic/military successes, making Hitler a symbol of unity at least until Stalingrad 🏆⚔️.

#### The racial state 💯

Worker's Stance in Nazi Germany 🛠

- Initially, historians like Mason saw worker's absenteeism and stoppages as acts of defiance. Later, he toned down the view, acknowledging that workers were essentially "imprisoned" with no room for rebellion.
- Younger workers were swayed by retraining and new job opportunities, while material benefits like longer holidays bought workers' acquiescence.
- Post-war, many workers nostalgically remembered 1934–39 for full employment and stability, not necessarily Nazi ideologies.

Policing the Volksgemeinschaft 👮‍♂️

- The Gestapo, Criminal Police, and uniformed police acted as the guardians of the Nazi social order. They targeted political and 'asocial' enemies.
- The Gestapo was not as omnipotent as believed, relying heavily on informants and block wardens for information.

The Hitler Myth 🎭

- Hitler was deified by Nazi propaganda, serving as an embodiment of national unity.
- The myth had varying degrees of success in different social groups but was a strong unifying force until the battle of Stalingrad.

Racial and Eugenic Policies in the Third Reich 🧬

- The regime aimed for a racially homogeneous 'Aryan' society, aiming to eliminate minorities and even 'lesser' Aryans.
- Influenced by earlier theories and the economic situation, eugenic policies gained traction, leading to forced sterilizations and eventually to euthanasia.
- Public outcry and tactical reasons led to a temporary halt in the euthanasia program, which had resulted in thousands of deaths.

Nazi Persecution Programs: Targeting Various Groups

- Euthanasia Program: Originally aimed at euthanizing the mentally sick, this program later included foreign workers with severe illnesses, prisoners, and even German soldiers with incurable conditions. Methods included starvation and lethal injections. Films like "I Accuse" were used to sway public opinion towards euthanasia. 💉🎬

Specific Target Groups

- 'Asocials' and Homosexuals: The Nazis believed that criminal and sexually deviant behaviors were genetically determined. Compulsory castration laws were enacted. Himmler, appointed chief of German police in June 1936, intensified arrests and incarcerations in concentration camps.👮🏻‍♂️🤔
  - Over 10,000 people were arrested and most perished in SS-owned quarries. Between 1937-1939, 25,000 homosexuals were arrested; 15,000 were sent to concentration camps.
- Ethnic Minorities: Policies targeting smaller ethnic groups like Sinti, Roma, Sorbs and part-Africans evolved between 1933–40.
  - Sinti and Roma were moved and sterilized; some were later sent to Auschwitz.
  - Sorbs were initially tolerated, but later their leaders were sent to concentration camps.
