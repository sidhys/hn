## chapter 22: reconstruction
   
#### general notes

key challeges being faced rn: how tf do we bring south back in union? how tf do we rebuild it? how tf do we protect black freedom? what branch of govt should even control reconstruction? should we forgive the southern leaders? wtf???

- how do we help freed blacks?
    - blacks were often unskilled, propertyless, poor, and illiterate
    - but they also just helped win the war
    - Addressed in the Freedmen's Bureau (supposed to helped former slaves & poor southern whites: food/shelter/medical/education) 
      - Taught 200k africans how to read, built many schools 
    - "fourty acres and a mule"
      - the (failed) idea of giving confiscated lands to slaves
      - nothing happened, africans still poor
- reconstruction plans     
    - Lincoln's Proclamation of Amnesty & Reconstruction: 'wartime reconstruction', plan was to give south an incentive to quit the fight 
        - southern states can rejoin union when 10% of the state voters pledge loyalty to union
        - they also HAVE TO accept emancipation
    - Wade-Davis plan: more strict  
        - 50% of state voters had to take an "iron clad" oath of allegiance
        - If you helped confederate side, you were excluded from new govt
        - pocket veto by lincoln
- lincoln DEAD!
    - Andrew Johnson (southern senator democrat) becomes pres, accepts lincoln's Proclamation of Amnesty & Reconstruction *but* southern leaders + southern people who own more than $20k of land lose ability to vote (they can appeal for a pardon tho) and states have to ratify 13th amendment 
    - Johsnon pardons most of the former confederate leaders, pisses off north republicans
        - southern planters get political control of sourthern politics (Former confederate VP Alexander Stephens gets senator of Georgia)
- southern defiance: black codes
    - black codes tried to establish a stable labor supply after emancipation 
        - prevented africans from renting land/borrowing money 
        - forced africans to sign labor contracts, or penalty
        - africans cant serve on a jury or vote 
    - forced africans to be sharecroppers (this sounds familiar!!)
- president johnson v congress 
    - north republicans mad that confederates back in office, leads to stricter reconstruction where congress takes over  
    - congress says NO to confederates coming back
    - johnson vetoed the freedmans bureau extension, congress overrides 
    - civil rights bill: gives citizenship to africans, got rid of black codes
       - Johnson vetoes, but bill still passed
*note: republicans control congess,  Radicals v Moderates*  
- congress: how can we stop south from overturning laws we pass for reconstruction? 14th amendment?
    - said all people born in US are citizens 
    - said states HAVE to protect person rights and provide "equal protection of the law" and "due process"
    - preventing former confederates from holding office
    - southern states would be punished for denying right to vote for black citizens   
- Reconstruction act of 1867 divided south into 5 military districts (UNION CONTROLLED)  
    - no right to vote for former confederates
    - to be readmitted as a state, new state constitution would need to be made INCLUDING black suffrage 
- JOHSNON IMPEACHED (1ST IMPEACHED PRESIDENT LOL L)  
    - 1867 tenure of office act reduced president power, protected republican reconstruction cabinet
        - said the senate has to approve of any presedential dismissal of a cabinet official or general
    - Johnson violates this when removing Sec of War Stanton, goes to house for impeachment, misses the 2/3 vote by one vote, leaving him still in office 
- Reconstruction Governments
    - new electorate in south bc of 15th amendment (universal male suffrage, right to vote can't be denied due to race, color, or previous condition of servitude)
    - Republican coalition: african male voters, scalawags (cooperating southern whites), carpetbaggers (notheners who went south for profit/to help out)
 - Fall of reconstruction 
    - KKK formed to secure white supremacy 
    - Force acts of 1870/1 try to stop resistance to reconstruction by putting federal troops into south 
    - Civil Rights act of 1875 guaranteed equal access to public places, and protected the right to serve on juries, but wasnt followed then later overturned 
    - by 1870s congress and president were unwilling to use federal govt to monitor southern society
 
 closing notes:
 
 reconstruction gave africans rights, but they were slowly stripped away | reconstruction amendments established judicial principles that became the basis of court upholding rights 
 
#### key terms (most terms from a quizlet)

__Oliver O. Howard__: Union general known as the "Christian general" because he tried to base his policy decisions on his deep religious piety. He was given charge of the Freedmen's Bureau in 1865, with the mission of integrating the freed slaves into Southern society and politics during the second phase of the Reconstruction Era.

__Andrew Johnson__: A political leader of the nineteenth century. He was elected vice president in 1864 and became president when Abraham Lincoln was assassinated in 1865. Heis one of two presidents to have been impeached; the House of Representatives charged him with illegally dismissing a government official. The Senate tried him, and he was acquitted by only one vote.

__Alexander Stephens__: An American politician from Georgia. He was Vice President of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. He also served as a U.S. Representative from Georgia (both before the Civil War and after Reconstruction) and as the 50th Governor of Georgia from 1882 until his death in 1883.

__Charles Sumner__: American Politician and senator from Massachusetts. He was the leader of the antislavery forces in Massachusetts and among the leaders of the Radical Republicans. During the Reconstruction Era he fought to decrease the power of ex-Confederates and given equal rights to Freedmen.

__Thaddeus Stevens__: A Republican leader and one of the most powerful members of the United States House of Representatives. He was chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee,and a witty, sarcastic speaker and flamboyant party leader who dominated the House from 1861 until his death and wrote much of the financial legislation that paid for the American Civil War.

__William Seward__: Johnson's Secretary of State who engineered the purchase of Alaska from Russia.

__Freedman's Bureau__: An agency of the War Department set up in 1865 to assist freed slaves in obtaining relief, land, Jobs, fair treatment, and education.

__13th amendment__: Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.

__moderate/radical republican__: Moderates did not actively support black voting rights and the distribution of confiscated lands to the freedmen, while Radicals did

__black codes__: Any code of law that defined and especially limited the rights of former slaves after the Civil War.

__sharecropping__: A system of farming that developed in the South after the Civil War, when landowners, many of whom had formerly held slaves, lacked the cash to pay wages to farm laborers, many of whom were former slaves. The system called for dividing the crop into three shares — one for the landowner, one for the worker, and one for whoever provided seeds, fertilizer, and farm equipment.

__civil rights act__: A federal law in the United States declaring that everyone born in the U.S. and not subject to any foreign power is a citizen, without regard to race, color, or previous condition of slavery or involuntary servitude.

__14th amendment__: An amendment to the U.S. Constitution, ratified in 1868, defining national citizenship and forbidding the states to restrict the basic rights of citizens or other persons

__"swing around the circle"__: A disastrous speaking campaign undertaken by U.S. President Andrew Johnson August 27 - September 15, 1866, in which he tried to gain support for his mild Reconstruction policies and for his preferred candidates (mostly Democrats) in the forthcoming midterm Congressional election. The tour received its nickname due to the route that the campaign took.

__Military Reconstruction Act__: Four statutes that were created for Reconstruction: Creation of five military districts in the seceded states not including Tennessee, which had ratified the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and was readmitted to the Union, required congressional approval for new state constitutions (which were required for Confederate states to rejoin the Union), confederate states must give voting rights to all men and all former Confederate states must ratify the 14th Amendment.

__15th amendment__: An amendment to the U.S. Constitution, ratified in 1870, prohibiting the restriction of voting rights "on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude."

__Ku Klux Klan__: A secret organization in the southern U.S., active for several years after the Civil War, which aimed to suppress the newly acquired powers of blacks and to oppose carpetbaggers from the North, and which was responsible for many lawless and violent proceedings.

__Force Acts__: Acts passed to promote African American voting and mainly aimed at limiting the activities of the Ku Klux Klan. Through the acts, actions committed with the intent to influence voters, prevent them from voting, or conspiring to deprive them of civil rights, including life, were made federal offenses. Thus the federal government had the power to prosecute the offenses, including calling federal juries to hear the cases.

__Tenure of Office Act__: Enacted over the veto of President Andrew Johnson, it denied the President of the United States the power to remove anyone who had been appointed by a past President without the advice and consent of the United States Senate, unless the Senate approved the removal during the next full session of Congress.

__"Seward's Folly"__:  Seward agreed to purchase Alaska from Russia for 7.2 million dollars. Critics attacked Seward for the secrecy surrounding the deal, which came to be known as “Seward's folly.” The press mocked his willingness to spend so much on “Seward's icebox” and Andrew Johnson's “polar bear garden.”

__10 percent plan__: A model for reinstatement of Southern states that decreed that a state could be reintegrated into the Union when 10 percent of the 1860 vote count from that state had taken an oath of allegiance to the U.S. and pledged to abide by emancipation.
